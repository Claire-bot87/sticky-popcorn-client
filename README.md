# Description
I completed this project in week 9 of the course. It was a full stack application with an express back end and react front end. It is a movie review website.

### Code Installation




#### For the frontend:
https://github.com/Claire-bot87/sticky-popcorn-client

#### For the backend:
https://github.com/Claire-bot87/sticky-popcorn-api

### Timeframe and Working Team
We had 1 week to complete this project. I worked in a group of three with my classmates Kamran and Mai. 


### Technologies Used
GitHub
Express
Node
React
MongoDB Compass
MongoDB Atlas
Bootstrap
Netlify


### Brief
Build a REST API using MongoDB, Express, Node
Build a front-end application using React, that uses fetch or axios to call the API
Authentication/Authorization should be implemented on both front-end and back-end
Beyond the user model you should have at least 2 more data entities, like posts and replies.
CRUD should be implemented on the front-end and back-end, that is to say that I should as a user be able to successfully make a GET, POST, PUT & DELETE request from the react app.
The project is deployed (guides will be provided)
